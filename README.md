## Contribution
To Contribute to Family Fit, please fork the application from the github repository, https://github.com/omcewan/family-fit. Then after adding the changes that you want to contribute to the application you will need then need to do a pull request to have your changes reviewed and merged to the main branch of the application. Currently we do not have functionality to add new families, so when testing the signup please user a number between 1 - 5 or leave blank. Otherwise you will get an error. Some changes that we wish to work on for Family Fit that you can contribute to are:
 * A form to allow post of new families. 
 * A form where family members can make posts and comment on each others posts as a way to motivate each other.
 * A chat system so while in the application familiy members can chat with each other.
 * Added funcitonality to the logging workout forms so that members can add their own type of workout and not just depend on the predefined list

These are just a few of the future ideas we would like to make for Family Fit and which you can contribute to.
